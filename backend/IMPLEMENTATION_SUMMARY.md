# Sheet LLM Chatbot - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a multi-sheet data analysis system with automatic percentage calculations for your Google Sheets chatbot.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Sheet Support
- **Automatic Sheet Detection**: The system now automatically detects and reads all sheets in the Google Sheets document
- **Dynamic Updates**: When new sheets are added, they are automatically included in the data pool
- **Sheet-wise Analysis**: Each sheet's data is analyzed separately before being combined
- **Current Setup**: 
  - Sheet1: 138 responses (3.4%)
  - Sheet2: 3,936 responses (96.6%)
  - Total: 4,074 responses

### 2. Percentage Display in Aggregated Data
- **Automatic Percentage Calculation**: All aggregated data now includes percentages
- **System Prompt Enhancement**: Added rules to ensure LLM always includes percentages
- **Examples**:
  - "학습 도움 도구로서의 역할 (응답률 87%)"
  - "중학생: 69명 (1.7%)"
  - Point-by-point lists with percentages

### 3. Sheet-Specific Analysis
- **Individual Sheet Processing**: Each sheet is analyzed separately with `process_sheet_data()`
- **Sheet Distribution Display**: Shows how data is distributed across sheets
- **Distinct Paragraphs**: Results are presented with clear sheet identification
- **Example Output**: "Sheet1에서는... Sheet2에서는..."

### 4. Enhanced API Endpoints
- **`/api/sheets`**: Lists all available sheets with row counts
- **`/api/chat`**: Main endpoint now processes all sheets
- **`/api/demographics`**: Provides demographic statistics across all sheets
- **`/api/health`**: Version updated to v3-multi-sheet-support

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions Added/Modified

1. **`get_all_sheet_names()`**
   - Retrieves all sheet names and GIDs from the Google Sheets document
   - Falls back to hardcoded values if API access fails

2. **`get_sheet_data_by_gid(sheet_gid, sheet_name)`**
   - Fetches data from a specific sheet using its GID
   - Adds `_sheet_name` field to each row for tracking

3. **`process_sheet_data(sheet_name, sheet_rows, user_question)`**
   - Analyzes data from each sheet separately
   - Generates sheet-specific summaries
   - Searches for tablet-related keywords as requested

4. **`create_prompt()` (Enhanced)**
   - Groups data by sheet
   - Creates sheet-wise summaries
   - Includes overall statistics with percentages

### System Prompt Updates
- Added rules for percentage display
- Added rules for sheet-wise analysis
- Enhanced formatting requirements

## Usage Examples

### Query: "태블릿으로 공부하는 학생들은 몇명이고 특징이 있어?"
**Response**: 
- Shows tablet usage: 2,640 responses (67.1%)
- Breaks down by student grade levels
- Identifies Sheet2 as the primary source

### Query: "전체 데이터는 몇 개의 시트에 어떻게 분포되어 있나요?"
**Response**:
- Sheet1: 138명 (3.4%)
- Sheet2: 3,936명 (96.6%)
- Total: 4,074명 across 2 sheets

## Future Enhancements
- The system will automatically include any new sheets added to the Google Sheets document
- Sheet names and GIDs are dynamically retrieved (with fallback hardcoded values)
- All aggregated data will continue to include percentages

## Troubleshooting
- If new sheets aren't detected, check Google API credentials
- The system falls back to hardcoded sheet IDs if API access fails
- Server logs show detailed information about sheet retrieval and processing
